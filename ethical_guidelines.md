# AI Ethical Guidelines for Primary School Teachers

## Introduction

These guidelines are designed to help primary school teachers implement AI tools in their classrooms in ways that are ethical, responsible, and beneficial for all students. As AI becomes more prevalent in education, it's important to establish clear principles for its use with young learners.

## Core Principles

### 1. Child-Centered Approach

**Key Principle:** All AI use should prioritize children's wellbeing, development, and learning needs.

**Guidelines:**
- Select AI tools designed specifically for educational purposes and appropriate age groups
- Ensure AI implementation supports, rather than detracts from, child development goals
- Consider the developmental appropriateness of AI interactions for different age groups
- Prioritize tools that encourage creativity, critical thinking, and social development

### 2. Privacy and Data Protection

**Key Principle:** Children's data must be protected with the highest standards of security and privacy.

**Guidelines:**
- Use only AI tools that comply with relevant data protection laws (GDPR, COPPA, etc.)
- Obtain appropriate parental consent before using AI tools that collect student data
- Avoid tools that collect unnecessary personal information from students
- Regularly review privacy policies of AI tools used in the classroom
- Teach students age-appropriate digital privacy concepts

### 3. Transparency and Explainability

**Key Principle:** Teachers, students, and parents should understand how AI tools work and make decisions.

**Guidelines:**
- Choose AI tools that provide clear explanations of how they function
- Explain to students, in age-appropriate terms, how AI tools work
- Be transparent with parents about AI use in the classroom
- Avoid "black box" AI systems where decision-making processes cannot be explained

### 4. Fairness and Inclusion

**Key Principle:** AI tools should be accessible to all students and free from bias.

**Guidelines:**
- Select AI tools that have been tested for bias and fairness
- Ensure AI tools are accessible to students with different abilities
- Monitor AI recommendations for potential bias or unfair patterns
- Provide alternatives for students who cannot or choose not to use AI tools
- Consider cultural and linguistic diversity when selecting AI tools

### 5. Human Oversight and Control

**Key Principle:** Teachers must maintain oversight and final decision-making authority over AI systems.

**Guidelines:**
- Never delegate critical educational decisions solely to AI systems
- Regularly review AI recommendations and assessments
- Maintain the ability to override AI decisions when necessary
- Use AI as a tool to enhance, not replace, teacher judgment
- Establish clear boundaries for AI use in the classroom

### 6. Educational Value

**Key Principle:** AI implementation should have clear educational benefits that align with curriculum goals.

**Guidelines:**
- Select AI tools that address specific learning objectives
- Evaluate whether AI tools enhance or detract from core educational experiences
- Balance AI use with other teaching methods and approaches
- Regularly assess the impact of AI tools on student learning outcomes
- Avoid using AI merely for novelty or entertainment value

### 7. Digital Citizenship

**Key Principle:** AI use should promote responsible digital citizenship and critical thinking.

**Guidelines:**
- Teach students to critically evaluate AI outputs and recommendations
- Help students understand AI limitations and potential errors
- Discuss ethical considerations of AI with students in age-appropriate ways
- Model responsible AI use for students
- Encourage students to question and not blindly trust AI systems

## Implementation Checklist

Before implementing an AI tool in your classroom, ask yourself:

1. Does this tool prioritize student wellbeing and development?
2. Does it adequately protect student privacy and data?
3. Can I explain how this tool works to students and parents?
4. Is this tool accessible and fair to all my students?
5. Do I maintain appropriate oversight and control?
6. Does it provide clear educational value aligned with my teaching goals?
7. Does it help students develop as responsible digital citizens?

If you cannot answer "yes" to all these questions, reconsider using the tool or seek additional information and support.
