# Assessment Methods and Feedback Mechanisms

This document outlines the assessment methods and feedback mechanisms for the AI Literacy Course for Primary School Teachers.

## Assessment Philosophy

The assessment approach for this course is designed to be:

1. **Formative and Summative**: Providing both ongoing feedback and end-of-module evaluation
2. **Practical and Reflective**: Focusing on real-world application and personal growth
3. **Supportive and Non-Punitive**: Creating a safe space for teachers to experiment with new concepts
4. **Time-Efficient**: Respecting teachers' busy schedules with manageable assessment activities

## Pre-Course Assessment

### Purpose
- Establish baseline knowledge and confidence levels
- Identify specific learning needs and areas of interest
- Customize course delivery based on participant needs

### Methods
- **AI Literacy Self-Assessment Questionnaire**
  - 10-minute digital survey on AI knowledge, attitudes, and current classroom practices
  - Results viewable immediately to participants with personalized learning recommendations

- **AI in Education Scenario Response**
  - Brief written response to a classroom scenario involving AI
  - Helps establish baseline approaches to AI integration

## Ongoing Assessment

### Purpose
- Provide regular feedback on progress
- Identify areas needing additional support
- Maintain engagement through achievable milestones

### Methods
- **Knowledge Check Quizzes**
  - Brief, auto-graded quizzes at the end of each module section
  - Immediate feedback with explanations for incorrect answers
  - Option to retake quizzes multiple times

- **Reflection Prompts**
  - Short written reflections on how content connects to personal teaching context
  - Saved in personal learning journal within the course platform

- **Peer Discussion Participation**
  - Asynchronous discussion forums for sharing ideas and questions
  - Emphasis on quality of contribution rather than quantity

## End-of-Module Assessment

### Purpose
- Demonstrate understanding of module content
- Apply learning to personal teaching context
- Create resources that can be used immediately in the classroom

### Methods
- **Module 1: AI Concept Map**
  - Visual representation of AI concepts and their relationships
  - Demonstrates conceptual understanding

- **Module 2: AI Tool Evaluation**
  - Structured evaluation of an AI tool relevant to participant's teaching area
  - Application of evaluation criteria from the course

- **Module 3: Lesson Plan Integration**
  - Modification of an existing lesson plan to thoughtfully incorporate AI tools
  - Focus on pedagogical purpose rather than technology for its own sake

- **Module 4: Ethical Case Study Analysis**
  - Analysis of an ethical dilemma related to AI in primary education
  - Application of ethical frameworks from the course

- **Module 5: Student AI Literacy Activity**
  - Creation of an age-appropriate activity to teach AI literacy concepts
  - Includes learning objectives, materials, and assessment approach

- **Module 6: AI Implementation Action Plan**
  - Structured plan for implementing AI literacy in participant's classroom or school
  - Includes timeline, resources needed, and success metrics

## Final Course Assessment

### Purpose
- Demonstrate comprehensive understanding across all modules
- Create a practical resource for immediate classroom use
- Provide closure and celebration of learning

### Methods
- **AI Literacy Teaching Portfolio**
  - Collection of key artifacts created throughout the course
  - Reflection on learning journey and next steps
  - Can be shared with colleagues and school leadership

- **Post-Course Self-Assessment**
  - Comparison with pre-course assessment to demonstrate growth
  - Identification of ongoing professional development needs

## Feedback Mechanisms

### Automated Feedback
- Immediate feedback on knowledge check quizzes
- Progress tracking dashboard showing completion status
- Digital badges awarded for module completion

### Peer Feedback
- Structured peer review opportunities for major assessments
- Collaborative discussion forums for sharing ideas and receiving input
- Optional peer observation protocols for classroom implementation

### Facilitator Feedback
- Written feedback on end-of-module assessments
- Optional one-on-one consultation sessions
- Group Q&A sessions for common questions and challenges

### Self-Reflection Tools
- Guided reflection prompts throughout the course
- Learning journal for documenting insights and questions
- Self-assessment rubrics for major assignments

## Accessibility Considerations

- Multiple formats for demonstrating understanding (written, visual, audio)
- Extended time accommodations available upon request
- Screen reader compatibility for all assessment materials
- Translation support for non-native English speakers
