# AI Glossary for Primary School Teachers

This glossary provides simple explanations of key AI terminology to help primary school teachers understand and discuss artificial intelligence concepts.

## A

**Algorithm**  
A set of step-by-step instructions that tells a computer how to perform a task or solve a problem.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  
Computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and identifying patterns.

**Automation**  
The use of technology to perform tasks with minimal human intervention.

## B

**Bias**  
When AI systems reflect or amplify unfair human prejudices or make systematically unfair predictions.

**Big Data**  
Extremely large datasets that can be analyzed to reveal patterns and trends.

## C

**Chatbot**  
A computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the internet.

**Computer Vision**  
The ability of computers to "see" and interpret visual information from the world.

## D

**Data**  
Information collected and stored for reference, analysis, or processing by AI systems.

**Deep Learning**  
A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze various factors of data.

## E

**Ethics in AI**  
The field concerned with ensuring AI systems are designed and used in ways that are fair, transparent, and beneficial to humanity.

## G

**Generative AI**  
AI systems that can create new content such as text, images, music, or videos based on patterns learned from existing data.

## M

**Machine Learning**  
A type of AI that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

## N

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
The ability of computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

**Neural Network**  
A computing system inspired by the human brain, designed to recognize patterns.

## P

**Personalized Learning**  
Educational experiences that are adapted to individual student needs, often using AI to determine appropriate content and pace.

**Predictive Analytics**  
Using data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes.

## R

**Robotics**  
The field of technology that deals with the design, construction, and operation of robots.

## S

**Speech Recognition**  
Technology that enables a device to recognize and translate spoken language into text.

**Supervised Learning**  
A type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on labeled data.

## T

**Training Data**  
The dataset used to teach an AI system to perform its intended task.

## U

**Unsupervised Learning**  
A type of machine learning where the algorithm identifies patterns in data without pre-existing labels.

## V

**Virtual Assistant**  
AI-powered software that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on commands or questions.
